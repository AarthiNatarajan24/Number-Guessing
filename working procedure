Understand the Code Structure:
The code uses the random module to generate a random number between 1 and 100.
The game runs in a loop, allowing up to 10 attempts.
It handles invalid inputs (e.g., non-numeric inputs) using a try-except block.
Feedback is given after each guess (too high, too low, or correct).
The game ends when the user guesses correctly or runs out of attempts.
Difficulty Levels:
Added a choose_difficulty() function that lets the user select from:
Easy: Numbers 1-50, 15 attempts.
Medium: Numbers 1-100, 10 attempts.
Hard: Numbers 1-200, 7 attempts.
The function returns the range (max_number), attempts (max_attempts), and difficulty name.
Play-Again Option:
After each game (win or lose), the user is prompted to play again.
Entering "yes" restarts the game with a new difficulty selection; any other input ends the game.
Scoring System:
Added a calculate_score() function that computes a score based on:
Remaining attempts: (remaining / max_attempts) * 1000.
Range bonus: (200 / max_number) * 100 (smaller ranges give higher bonuses).
The score is rounded to a whole number and displayed on a win.
A score of 0 is given if the user runs out of attempts.
